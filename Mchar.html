                <h1>Major Characters</h1>
                <div class="character-description">
                    <h3>Chaser, Scholar of the Burning Blood</h3>
                    <p>Was once an aspiring Diver, graduating as one of the greatest of his generation, only surpassed
                        by Klaris Llfiend, Mother of Lights and Akira. Eventually, he betrayed the Divers, joining the Ministry instead.
                        He served as an apprentice for and was gifted the ability of hemokinesis by the Ministry's Second Prophet.</p>
                        <br>

                    <h3>Klaris Llfiend</h3>
                    <p>Of the Divers, she is considered one of the strongest, surpassing Chaser and being on par with Akira to the point
                        that he cannot instantly kill her with his Resonance, as well as being able to become intangible.
                        She is rather rude at times, frequently insulting those she views as weak, and is generally disliked by her fellow Divers.
                        She also appears rather arrogant, as she banished Cap'n Orlandeau to New Kyrsa</p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Zi'eer "The Lord Regent"</h3>
                    <p> Zi'eer, more commonly known as The Lord Regent or by his title, the fourth Prophet of The Ministry, is a mysterious and powerful NPC that resides exclusively inside his palace within Etris.
                        He is the interim ruler of Etrea, holding absolute power over the entire nation until the "King" returns to his people.</p>
                        <br>

                    <h3>Evengarde Rest</h3>
                    <p>Evengarde Rest is the current Maestro of the Vigil Guard and is highly respected by all of them.
                        He resides within the Isle of Vigils and is found in their dojo, watching people train.
                        A kind of intimidating air lingers around him, and it prevents you from introducing yourself to him until you save a Vigil swordsman named Isaac.</p>
                        <br>

                    <h3>Akira</h3>
                    <p>Akira is a young Etrean with widely scuffled hair, a frown, and sharp eyes. He wears the Black Diver outfit, and a pair of Dewdrop Earrings.
                        Despite him lacking in the experience department due to his young age, he's one of the strongest Black Divers, surpassing Klaris, Chaser and the strongest players.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Shrine of Yun'Shul, Keeper of Hearts</h3>
                    <p>The Shrine of Yun'Shul, Keeper of Hearts is a shrine found in the Temple of Hearts, locked behind
                        a Resonance Door within the First Layer of The Depths, dedicated to the Drowned God Yun’shul. The Shrine of Yun’Shul is a unique interactable shrine found in Scyphozia.
                        It can grant players that wield a Resonance wishes.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Ethiron, the Eye of Calamity</h3>
                    <p>Little is known about Ethiron other than that they are the Drowned God of wind, pressure and sky.
                        Chaser describes New Kyrsa as like a bedchamber to Ethiron, with the Kyrsgarde working hard to keep them asleep.
                        Ethiron seemingly emits a fog known as Mist Presence, which eventually brainwashed them and the Lost Divers into worshipping them
                        and devoting themselves to helping the Scion of Ethiron grow.</p>
